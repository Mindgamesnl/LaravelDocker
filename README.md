# What?
Small docker template for laravel applications (with Nginx + Mysql) because I know that you are a lazy shit and find Docker too much effort. Well, not anymore.
# How?
Base docker php/mysql setup.

`./build.sh` to build

`./up.sh` to start

`./down.sh` to stop

public php root at `app/public`
